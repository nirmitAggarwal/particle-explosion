# Particle Explosion

This project demonstrates a particle explosion effect using p5.js. Particles are created and animated to simulate an explosion effect in the center of the canvas. The particles fade out and are removed once they move off-screen.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file that sets up the page and includes the p5.js library and the `sketch.js` script.
- `styles.css`: Basic styling to remove default margins and set a black background.
- `sketch.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the p5.js code for the particle system.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have an internet connection to load the p5.js library from the CDN.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the particle explosion effect in action.

## Dependencies

- [p5.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.0/p5.js): A JavaScript library for creative coding.
